## About Me

I'm an enthusiastic and detail-oriented Frontend Developer seeking an entry-level position to use my skills in coding, troubleshooting complex problems, and assisting in the timely completion of projects.

I have no practical work experience yet but i am very passionate about web development.

I used to work in a bank, so I have a lot of experience in solving non-standard tasks, attention to the exact execution of tasks, the ability to work until the goal is achieved and an understanding of the importance of teamwork.
